# 2. HTML

### 2.1 What is HTML

#### A little history

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, it is a markup language for designing webpage structures. What is markup you ask? Well, markup language is not like programming language, programming languages will contain logic, a lot of logic. Where markup language does not care about logic. Whatever you write gets rendered by your browser and displayed on your page. There is no such thing as bug in markup languages because there is no logical expressions.

#### HTML's role in a web page

What does HTML do on a web page? Basically every thing. Everything you see on a website is marked up using HTML. Images, links, paragraphs, headers, videos, they are all written with HTML!

Think about HTML like the structures of a building, the floors, the ceiling, the walls and the doors. The building is your website.

### 2.2 HTML structures

## `<div>Hello world</div>`

This is a typical HTML tag, the &lt;div&gt;s wrapping around the words "Hello world" is the tag. There is a beginning and an ending tag

Every single HTML page needs the same boilerplate to begin with, you may add additional code to this boilerplate based on your needs, but here it comes:

```
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <title>Page Title</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        
    </body>
</html>
```

Write the above code in your editor and you have just written your first HTML page.

#### What are these

`<!DOCTYPE html>` is the beginning tag for any HTML5 pages. HTML5 is the latest version of HTML, which comes with a lot of exciting features, for you to be able to use these features, you have to let the browser know that you're writing in HTML5 by including this tag at the top of your document.
